## Open Hardware Devices
To facilitate the deployment of open smart devices capable of measuring "electromagnetic activity" in the surrounding environment, indoors or outdoors, this repository includes the KiCad project files to expedite prototyping by DIY hobbyists and Makers. There's also the option to buy at a reduced, fair price on my [tindie.com store](tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/) price starts at around 50 eur.

To view a list of open hardware electronics, cost-free, and available for anyone to download and use on their projects, navigate to the bottom of this page. 

## Send the collected sensor data to this repository
On this repository, there's a special folder, named [datasets](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Safety-Health/tree/main/Measurements/datasets), where anyone is able to upload dataset files directly from their open smart devices. This folder is intended to facilitate sharing of "electromagnetic" measurements among anyone with interest and capable of studying and analyzing it in search of EM anomalies to improve detection of the open hardware electronics made available here. **Anyone is invited to participate, cost-free**. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To assist you with the firmware programming, there's a C++ test code compatible with all Arduino devices that anyone can use to speed up the programming of the open smart device. Here's the link: <br>
https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Aeonlabs-Arduino_Hardware_Test_Code/tree/main/github_api_test_upload <br>

### ‚åõ [Carbon Fiber EMF Protection Helmet](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Aeonlabs-Carbon-Fiber-EMF-Protection-Helmet)  [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat&label=Contributions&colorA=red&colorB=black	)](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Safety-Health/blob/main/README.md#contribute-to-open-hardware-)
The helmet Magneto uses is made of an ultra-high strength carbon fiber composite ( see X-Men movies) ..... however, to function properly and stop the "voices" of Charles Xavier, there's a piece of electronics missing. An extreme-low-power energy harvester device. Buy a rigid carbon fiber helmet on AliExpress [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCsIVkJ). 

The helmet I bought has been delivered. In the upcoming weeks, I'll be designing flexible hardware electronics capable of detecting and providing some degree of protection (and shielding) from any electromagnetic activity around, and near, a victim's head.  Follow this project to get the latest updates, link on the menu at the top of the page. Thank you.

This smart device is intended to be installed and fixed into a copper electromagnetic (EM) shield on any EM indoor window or balcony door. It has the main ability to collect EM sensor data from the curtain itself and send it to a public data repository, for instance, a #dataverse (see www.dataverse.org)

### üü° [Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environment-EM-RF-Energy-Monitor) [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat&label=Contributions&colorA=red&colorB=black	)](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Safety-Health/blob/main/README.md#contribute-to-open-hardware-)

  
  This Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor does not solve the electromagnetic health concern one may have indoors. However, is a step forward in correctly identifying such electromagnetic disturbances nearby, for instance, when observing recurrently a mid-air energy spike, with the most common visual effect, a really small bright light flash. This smart device is able to do electromagnetic (EM) radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID),  which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.

  This Smart Indoor Env. GSM Cell Tower Monitor is built to do active monitoring of GSM Cell Towers nearby to look for any kind of hidden GSM/4G device repeater. Known to be used for stealing one's GSM communications data using some kind of Man-in-the-middle attack. This smart device is able to do GSM/4G radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID), which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.

This Smart Indoor plant monitoring and watering is designed to be inserted into any indoor plant vase. Is able to measure and calculate the moisture content in the vase, and when detects low water contents, activates the water pump. Is able to connect to a local home server to upload indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality measurement data. This way, the owner, can have a history record database, without the need for expensive cloud subscriptions.  Additionally, it features a 6 LED system composed of an ultraviolet LED, an Infrared LED and an RGB LED, when combined with multiple devices like this one in the same room is able to perform some basic light aggression protection from an unknown light source outside during the night & day.
