"...in the United States, 40,000 women die from breast cancer each year.... "

There are 40,000 women who are persecuted and attacked per year with some device or contraption that causes the medical condition known as "cancer". Worse, many medical treatments are the main reason for death.

Simply, because the victim is not capable of turning off the devices that attack him/her repetitively and recurrently. All because the victim does not have a device capable of detecting and monitoring this type of invisible and wireless aggression. And as if it weren't enough, it's a mandatory condition, to have some daily record, a #LogBook, a #history of occurrences of this type of aggression, capable of serving as evidence, preferably one that can be used in "real-time" and remotely by authorities and law enforcement. 

What happens when the detector is the body of a person or animal?

## ⚠️ Safety usage of the smart devices provided below ⚠️

The smart safety & health solutions available below, are for the kind of wireless aggression that behaves like ripples in a pond. For instance Wireless electromagnetic radios, including those found on smartphones, tablets, WIFI routers at home, and many more. (except those with directional beam forming technologies). This type of aggression has the characteristic to happen only during short periods of time, in the order of milliseconds or less regardless of electromagnetic radiation conditions and threshold limits of wireless networks.

## How to proceed
If you are certain some kind of wireless aggression causes your health-related problem, the first thing you need to do is to seek a wireless communications expert or engineer and ask him/her to audit your home, workplace (or another place you find it to be the root cause) to setup measurement devices (more than 2), for electromagnetic radiation detection (or other, for instance, photonics, also known as lasers) and do active monitoring 24/7. The monitoring setup needs to be able to do sensor data measurement uploads to an experimental data repository (see Table 1 above). At the same time is a mandatory requirement to notify authorities and include the web address link where sensor data is being uploaded and stored.

⚠️ **Only after you have the data measurements is advised to go to a conventional medical doctor/medicine.**

### ✓ 🟢 [Smart EMF Shield Curtain for Windows and Balconies](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/Aeonlabs-Home-Automation-Smart-EMF-Shield-Curtain-for-Windows-and-Balconies)
<sup> **status: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">M.V.P.</a>** NOW SELLING on <a href="tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/">Tindie.com</a>  </sup> <br>

This smart device is intended to be installed and fixed into a copper electromagnetic (EM) shield on any EM indoor window or balcony door. It has the main ability to collect EM sensor data from the curtain itself and send it to a public data repository, for instance, a #dataverse (see www.dataverse.org)

### [Carbon Fiber EMF Protection Helmet]() (soon !)
The helmet Magneto uses is made of an ultra-high strength carbon fiber composite ( see X-Men movies) ..... however, to function properly and stop the "voices" of Charles Xavier, there's a piece of electronics missing. An extreme-low-power energy harvester device.

### [Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environment-EM-RF-Energy-Monitor)
  
  This Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor does not solve the electromagnetic health concern one may have indoors. However, is a step forward in correctly identifying such electromagnetic disturbances nearby, for instance, when observing recurrently a mid-air energy spike, with the most common visual effect, a really small bright light flash. This smart device is able to do electromagnetic (EM) radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID),  which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.

### [Smart Indoor Environment GSM 4G Cell Tower Identification](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environement-GSM-4G-Cell-Tower-Identification)
  
  This Smart Indoor Env. GSM Cell Tower Monitor is built to do active monitoring of GSM Cell Towers nearby to look for any kind of hidden GSM/4G device repeater. Known to be used for stealing one's GSM communications data using some kind of Man-in-the-middle attack. This smart device is able to do GSM/4G radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID), which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.

## Indoor Plants
  ### [Indoor Smart Plant Watering with builtin microwave LED Jammer](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Indoor-Smart-Plant-Watering)
  
This Smart Indoor plant monitoring and watering is designed to be inserted into any indoor plant vase. Is able to measure and calculate the moisture content in the vase, and when detects low water contents, activates the water pump. Is able to connect to a local home server to upload indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality measurement data. This way, the owner, can have a history record database, without the need for expensive cloud subscriptions.  Additionally, it features a 6 LED system composed of an ultraviolet LED, an Infrared LED and an RGB LED, when combined with multiple devices like this one in the same room is able to perform some basic light aggression protection from an unknown light source outside during the night & day.
